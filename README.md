## üëã Hi, I'm Jorge Laborda  

I'm a **PhD in Artificial Intelligence** with a strong background in **Bayesian Networks, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing**. My PhD thesis focuses on **Structural Learning and Fusion of Bayesian Networks**, with applications in high-dimensional domains and distributed learning.

### üîπ Skills  
- **Programming:** Python, Java, SQL,...  
- **Machine Learning & AI:** Bayesian Networks, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning,...
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, MongoDB, CI/CD, Github Actions,...   
- **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, ETL,...  

### :man_scientist: Experience
- **AI PhD Student Researcher:** I was a PhD student doing my thesis about Bayesian Networks (2019-2025)
- **University Professor Associate:** During my PhD, I prepared and gave **160 hours** of classes regarding Java Programming, Programming Methodology, and Concurrency in Java. (2019-2023)

### :student: Education
